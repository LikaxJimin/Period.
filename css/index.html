    <p>A Walk to Remember is a romantic drama that will capture the hearts of those looking for a very emotional and sentimental story of true love. The movie is an account of how two people from different backgrounds and values can affect each other in such a way that brings them together to create an emotional bond that is the basis of this film.
        The story starts out with a boy named Landon, who is troubled and lost in the distractions of his rebellious peers. Landon is faced with the punishments of a recent incident where he is caught and punished for acts related to a prank played on a friend. As part of his punishment, he is required to take part in community service activities that lead him to interact with the quiet and shy, Jamie. He must part take in a school play as the lead opposite Jamie.
        At first Landon sees Jamie as nothing more than the socially reserved girl who is the object of his friends tormenting and teasing. In addition to participating in the play, he must convince everyone that he is serious about it and this requires a little coaching from Jamie. He solicits her help and their interaction is awkward at first, but a connection soon becomes evident as he notices a side to her that is soft, loving and caring. This also touches upon feelings that are new to him and slowly falls for her and is blinded by her never failing faith and kindness.
        As Landon and Jamie grow closer to one another, Jamie warns him not to fall in love with her. Landon ignores her with curiosity, but ends up falling in love with her nevertheless. He soon discovers why she made such a statement to him. Jamie is dying of leukemia and is not expected to live very much longer. As this is revealed, Landon strives to do all that he can to preserve the moments they have to spend together.
        The film wraps up with Landon thinking of his love, Jamie as she is forever a part of him memory and the one thing that made the difference in his life that changed him forever. The film is filled with all the romance that lovers search for and often forget they possess all along.</p>

            <p>When Jamie agrees to help Landon with his lines for a play, she says, “You have to promise you won’t fall in love with me.” "That's not a problem," he responds, laughing. Obviously, this wouldn't be a tear-jerker on its own, but given that he eventually does fall in love with her and we understand why that was a condition of hers... yep. Tear-jerker.</p>

                <p>On their first date, Landon helps Jamie cross one thing off of her bucket list: being in two places at once. He takes her to the state line where she can have one foot in Virginia and the other in their home state of North Carolina. Landon goes to extreme lengths to prove his devotion and love to her, and obviously, we later realize why Jamie has a bucket list at all.
                  <p> Another thing on her bucket list was to get a tattoo. When Landon puts a temporary tattoo of a butterfly on her shoulder, the thoughtful gesture made girls around the world get weepy.

                It's one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the movie -- when Jamie tells Landon she has leukemia. 
                    “No, you’re 18, you’re perfect,” Landon says. She responds, “No, I found out two years ago, and I’ve stopped responding to treatments.”</p>
                    <p>
                        "I'm scared of not being with you," she says, to which Landon responds, "Oh, baby, that will never happen." </p>
                        <p>After Jamie faints, she is admitted to the hospital, where Landon never leaves her side. </p>

            <p>Jamie, extremely weak at this point, walks down the aisle with her dad who formerly disapproved of her relationship with Landon. </p>
            <p>When Landon returns to see Jamie's dad four years after her death, he tells him, "I'm sorry she never got her miracle." Her dad responds, "She did. It was you."
                A sob fest ensues, especially when the movie ends with the following sentence:  “Love is like the wind. You can’t see it, but you can feel it.”</p>
